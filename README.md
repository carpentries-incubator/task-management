# Task Management for Humans as Self Care

This is a new lesson built with [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 

## Overview

This lesson will introduce you to a number of tools designed to help you work more efficiently. 
The aim is not to increase your productivity for the benefit of your employer,
but as a form of self-care. The idea is to help you keep on top of your tasks, to reduce anxiety
and make sure that you can have a life outside the office.  
   
We do not intend to present a single solution for everyone, but you may find some techniques 
from these various frameworks work for you. This lesson is aimed at the research software engineering 
community but may also be useful to those working in other areas.
