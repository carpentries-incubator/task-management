## Problem statement

- Lots of "productivity" tools, systems, techniques in the world
- Mostly written by privileged, successful individuals
- 

---

## Proposed solution

- Online resource, for use as:
  1. A workshop template
  2. A reference guide
- Introduce existing task-management ideas
- Refocus them away from "productivity" as value for your employer
- Contextualise with key issues, e.g.
  - Disability & neurodiversity
  - Burnout
  - Imposter syndrome
  
---

## Why?

- It's the resource we all wished we had!

## Design decisions

- Build on Carpentries infrastructure
- CC-BY 4.0 (consistent with Carpentries)

notes:

- Mention review process
  - Protected main branch
  - Review each other's pull requests
  
---

## Process decisions

- GitHub & GitHub projects
- Timeboxed sprints
- Hybrid (Zoom/in-person) communication
- Slack as main comms channel
- Division of labour/tasks
