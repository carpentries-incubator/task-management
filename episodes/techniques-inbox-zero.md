## What is Inbox Zero?

Productivity guru [Merlin Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_Mann) began sharing the inbox zero method in the early 2000s as a way for people to “reclaim their inbox.” Based on David Allen’s [*Getting Things Done*](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) productivity system, inbox zero helps you keep your inbox under control so you can spend less time on email and more time focused on your work or other responsibilities.

In this carpentry episode it is important to recognise that the inbox zero method doesn't only have to be used to increase productivity. This technique can be used purely for improving mental health at work by:

 1. Reducing the burden of nagging emails.
 2. Freeing up your mind for other tasks.
 3. Becoming more organised.


Instead of covering all aspects of `inbox zero` upfront, we will leave you to do further reading later, if you feel this technique could help you.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Practice 1: Value Your Time

The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, states that roughly 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes. This rule can also be applied to email management as only about 20 percent of emails deserve our attention. Luckily, many parts of the zero inbox method help you value your time and use it more effectively.

Because email notifications both create a distraction and often go ignored, we recommend you **turn off all email notifications**. Instead, dedicate short, specific time slots throughout the day for email management. This helps you value your time and focus your attention on your inbox without distractions so you can organize your messages quickly.

```
Why not try right now to turn off email notifications. If you are using Windows 11 you can enable `do not disturb` mode like this:

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
